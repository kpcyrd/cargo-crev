# cargo-crev

> A cryptographically verifiable **c**ode **rev**iew system for the cargo (Rust)
> package manager.

## Introduction

[Crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/crev/) is a language and ecosystem agnostic,
distributed **c**ode **rev**iew system.

`cargo-crev` is an implementation of Crev as a command line tool integrated with
`cargo`. This tool helps Rust users evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of
their package dependencies.

## Features

`cargo-crev` can already:

- warn you about untrustworthy crates and security vulnerabilities,
- display useful metrics about your dependencies,
- help you identify dependency-bloat,
- allow you to review most suspicious dependencies and publish your findings,
- use reviews produced by other users,
- increase trustworthiness of your own code,
- build a web of trust of other reputable users to help verify the code you use,

and many other things with many more to come.

## Getting started

Static binaries are available from the [releases
page](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/releases).

Follow the [`cargo-crev` - Getting Started
Guide](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/blob/master/cargo-crev/src/doc/getting_started.md)
(more documentation available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/cargo-crev)).

`cargo-crev` is a work in progress, but it should be usable at all times. Join
our [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#crev:matrix.org) or
[gitter](https://gitter.im/crev-dev/cargo-crev) channel, get help, report
problems and feedback. Thank you\!

## Raise awareness

If you're supportive of the cause, we would appreciate helping to raise
awareness of the project. Consider putting the below note in the README of your
Rust
    projects:

    It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)
    to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.

Thank you\!
